# Twemoji as a font

This aims to generate working colour fonts from [Twemoji](https://github.com/twitter/twemoji).

Formats that are going to be tested:
* Mozilla/Adobe’s SVG in OpenType, supported by Gecko, using SVGs and [FxEmoji’s scripts](https://github.com/mozilla/fxemoji).
* Microsoft’s multi-layers OpenType, supported by Gecko and Windows, using SVGs and unknown scripts.
* Google’s embeded PNG in OpenType, supported by Freetype, using PNGs and maybe [Behdad’s scripts](https://github.com/behdad/color-emoji).
